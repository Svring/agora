name: Mulmaster (City of Danger)
description: A corrupt, crime-ridden city-state on the windswept shores of the Moonsea, wedged between two peaks. Mulmaster is a cut-throat place where wealth and power are ruthlessly pursued under the harsh rule of the Council of Blades, High Blade Jaseen Drakehorn, and the dictates of the Church of Bane. Poverty is rampant in the lower districts, while the elite revel in the Imperial District.
